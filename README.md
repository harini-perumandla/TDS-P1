# TDS-P1

**>** To scrape data using the GitHub API, first i created a personal access token for authentication, I used python script and parsing the JSON responses to extract the users and repositories data i need.
## Files
1. `users.csv`: Contains information about 475 GitHub users in Zurich with over 50 followers
2. `repositories.csv`: Contains information about 29310 public repositories from these users
3. `tds-p1.ipynb`: Python notebook used to collect this data

**>** One of the most interesting findings from analyzing GitHub data is the strong preference for certain languages among specific user demographics. For instance, while Python and JavaScript dominate overall usage, niche communities showed a surprising affinity for languages like Rust and Go.Users with more contributors and active discussions tend to receive higher stars and forks.

**>** Based on the analysis, an actionable recommendation for developers is to actively engage with their community through regular updates, responsive communication, and encouraging contributions. Establishing a welcoming environment by providing clear contribution guidelines, maintaining an active issue tracker, and fostering discussions can significantly enhance collaboration.
